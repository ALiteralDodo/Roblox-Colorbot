# USAGE GUIDE (From the source)

- Windows 10/11 Only!

- Download the Source code, then extract it to a folder. Run installer.bat as admin. YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER, ITS A FALSE POSITIVE NOT A VIRUS YOU CAN READ THE SOURCE CODE ITS OPEN. After that you can run the .py

- Enable "Enemy Color Outlines" in Arsenal settings

- Drag each R G B slide in the settings all the way to the right, then back to the left to fix a bug in Arsenal.

- Change them to the color you choose in the config.ini. Your options are Green, Yellow, Pink/Magenta/Purple and Blue. Capitalization is unimportant as long as you spell the color correctly.

- Note: When using pink/magenta/purple, make sure that you change the crosshair color as the default is the same color as the enemies. Otherwise, the aimbot's not gonna work.

- Once you set the config with the color and did the color in Arsenal settings, open aimsource.py.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

- Do not contact me on Discord with your troubles. Only use the "Issues" tab in this GitHub. I will not take any longer than maybe a few minutes to attempt to help you, and that is final.

- If the installer fails at installer.bat, download Python: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.7/python-3.11.7-amd64.exe . After opening that, check "Add Python.exe to PATH" before installing **REALLY IMPORTANT**. Then, open cmd (command prompt) as admin and run:
    - pip install Pillow mss configparser opencv-python numpy colorama pywin32

- Aim shaky? Lower your speed
  
- Crashing? Screen record your screen and include the program's GUI. Send the error to the "Issues" tab in a new issue on this GitHub page.

- Not aiming at all? Make sure you set the color correctly. You must FULLY slide the R G B bar under "Enemy Color Outlines". Also make sure you did the part where you slide each color bar fully to the right then fully to the left before setting the correct color (fixes an Arsenal bug). If that doesn't work, try exiting "True" Fullscreen or attempting to use WindowedFullscreen (both of these are not included with default Roblox). If this doesn't work, try it without Bloxstrap or any other optimized Roblox version. If you are using the UWP, try using the web version. Please also ensure that Valorant, FACEIT, or any EAC-protected games are closed. (These anti-cheats either block or will ban you for using this script even though you are not actively using it in their game)
