# CREDITS

- Seconb (Primary developer)
- AndrewDarkyy (https://github.com/AndrewDarkyy) (https://discord.gg/hH62fKGJnv) (Co-developer, contributed many features such as aim smoothening and checking if Roblox is open. NOT OFFICIALLY A DEVELOPER AT THIS TIME)
- Befia/Taylor (Contributed some bugfixes and comments to explain certain areas of code, not an actual developer for the project though)

# FEATURES

- Aimbot based on the outlines around enemies in Arsenal (Arsenal only at this time, but if you know of another **ROBLOX** game that uses color outlines and is popular, tell me!
- Triggerbot (automatically shoots enemies if enabled!)
- Adjustable aim (where it aims like their head or their body, and the speed and distance it does that from)
- Easy configuration via a file!
- Simplified installation
- Many choices for enemy outline colors!
- Doesn't require Windows Defender off like other cheats!

# TUTORIAL VIDEO (USAGE GUIDE MAY STILL BE HELPFUL)

- https://streamable.com/wydt64
- If the video contains any errors or genuine mistakes please dm Seconb on Discord. Note that if you DM me regarding problems you will be blocked. Use the "Issues" tab in the GitHub repo.
- The video may eventually be outdated as new features are released, the video will not be replaced until core elements are changed.

# USAGE GUIDE (From the source)

- Windows 10/11 Only! May have issues on some stretched or otherwise unusual resolutions (i.e 1152x852 or 1366x768). 1080p, 1440p, or 4k is recommended. Mouse Acceleration should be turned off for best results.

- Bloxstrap support is not guaranteed (True fullscreen), if you have issues using Bloxstrap then try the regular verson of Web Roblox. UWP users may also face problems.

- Download the Source code, install Python from this link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe and check "Add Python.exe to PATH" before actually installing. Then run installer.bat.

- Enable "Enemy Color Outlines" in Arsenal settings

- Drag each R G B slide in the settings all the way to the right, then back to the left to fix a bug in Arsenal.

- Change them to the color you choose in the config.ini. Your options are Green, Yellow, Pink/Magenta/Purple and Blue. Capitalization is unimportant as long as you spell the color correctly.

- Note: When using pink/magenta/purple, make sure that you change the crosshair color as the default is the same color as the enemies. Otherwise, the aimbot's not gonna work.

- Once you set the config with the color and did the color in Arsenal settings, open aimsource.py.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

- Do not contact me on Discord with your troubles. Only use the "Issues" tab in this GitHub. I will not take any longer than maybe a few minutes to attempt to help you, and that is final.

- Aim shaky? Lower your speed
  
- Crashing/Instantly closes when opened? Open CMD by typing CMD in the Windows Search bar (press the Windows Key), then copy the path to the folder where your colorbot is, and type cd path/to/the/colorbot into CMD. Next, type "python aimsource.py" or whatever you named the .py file.

- Not aiming at all? Make sure you set the color correctly. You must FULLY slide the R G B bar under "Enemy Color Outlines". Also make sure you did the part where you slide each color bar fully to the right then fully to the left before setting the correct color (fixes an Arsenal bug). If that doesn't work, try exiting Bloxstrap and using normal roblox, or if you're on normal Roblox try Bloxstrap. If this doesn't work, try uninstalling Python and installing a completely different version. By default, the colorbot uses 3.10, but try 3.11, 3.9, or 3.12. When installing, make sure you check "Add Python.EXE to PATH", then after installing Python run installer.bat again. If you are using the UWP, try using the web version. Please also ensure that Valorant, FACEIT, or any EAC-protected games are closed. (These anti-cheats either block or will ban you for using this script even though you are not actively using it in their game)
